# pandoc extensions

Filters and other goodies to get the most out of [pandoc][], the
universal document converter.

## Principles

- Filters share a similar design and usage pattern.

- When sensible, the filters or templates are setup to be usable
  as [quarto][] extensions.

- All code is released under the [MIT license].

- Lua code follows the [HsLua style guide]
